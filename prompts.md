CREATE THE DEMOS
I need to create some demos for a presentation on AI assisted software
development. The topics I want to cover are:
The AI enabled builder, and builder-adjacent roles. This includes:
Researching projects with agents
Planning projects with agents
Building software with agents
Testing software with agents

I also want to cover:
Custom agents / Multi-agent orchestration
Skills
Rules
MCP Servers

I will be using claude code as my terminal app, and github copilot as my vs
code extension. I also want to showcase parallel agent workflows, both in my
own terminal and on GitHub. The MCP servers I plan to show are:
Context 7
Microsoft Docs
AWS Documentation
Jira

Lastly, one of the most important things I want to show is spec-driven
development, for which we'll be using GitHub spec kit (in claude code and
github copilot).

It might also be cool to show the modularity of skills w/ custom agents, and
how tools are assigned to different agents based on their skills.

Can you help me come up with some demos for each of these topics? Each demo
should be concise but illustrative of the capabilities of AI-assisted
software development.

RALPH LOOP USER DISCOVERED THE ISSUE
Ok... so that took just a second, but I finally found the official plugin.
You can invoke it with /ralph-loop and there are variations as well like
/ralph-loop:help, etc. Can you double check our docs and make sure that this
is what we will use? If we need to update any of the demos that's ok, let's
do it. Oh, and you might want to compact first. You're going to run out of
your context window soon.
